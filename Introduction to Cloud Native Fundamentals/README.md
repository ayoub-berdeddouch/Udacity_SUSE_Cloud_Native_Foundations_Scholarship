# Lesson 1 : Introduction to Cloud Native Fundamentals

- In this lesson, we will learn how to construct a CI/CD pipeline that will containerize an application and deployed it to a Kubernetes cluster.
Cloud-native refers to the set of practices that empowers an organization to build and manage applications at scale. They can achieve this goal by using private, hybrid, or public cloud providers. In addition to scale, an organization needs to be agile in integrating customer feedback and adapting to the surrounding technology ecosystem

- Containers are closely associated with cloud-native terminology. Containers are used to run a single application with all required dependencies. 
- Microservices are used to manage and configure a collection of small, independent services that can be easily packaged and executed within a container.
- Kubernetes had its first initial release in 2014 and it derives from Borg, a Google open-source container orchestrator. Currently, Kubernetes is part of CNCF or Cloud Native Computing Foundation. 
- CNCF was founded in 2015, and it provides a vendor-neutral home to open-source projects such as Kubernetes, Prometheus, ETCD, Envoy, and many more.
- An engineering team can use cloud-native tooling to enable quick delivery of value to customers and easily extend to new features and technologies. 
- When trialing cloud-native tooling, there are two main perspectives to address: business and technical stakeholders.
- From a business perspective, the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:
  - Agility - perform strategic transformations
  - Growth - quickly iterate on customer feedback
  - Service availability - ensures the product is available to customers 24/7
- From a technical perspective, the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:
  - Automation - release a service without human intervention
  - Orchestration - introduce a container orchestrator to manage thousands of services with minimal effort
  - Observability - ability to independently troubleshoot and debug each component
- Kubernetes is a container orchestrator that is capable to solutionize the integration of the following functionalities:
  - Runtime
  - Networking
  - Storage
  - Service Mesh
  - Logs and metrics
  - Tracing
